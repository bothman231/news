This is a real simple example of a spring boot executable .war.
You can take the generated .war (as created by maven install) and
drop it on any machine running java
then execute with java -jar Java_Scheduler-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war
and it will run and loop based on the schedule set in the code.

You can use this as a heart beat from a remote system.

set env vars
B_CONFIG_ROOT=c:\unique
B_SYSTEM_NAME=hudzen10

Also create a config.properties file at c:\{B_CONFIG_ROOT}\JAVA_CONF\${INSTANCE} with at least a node 
entry in it 
i.e.
node=01

java -jar -Dinstance=A js.war
